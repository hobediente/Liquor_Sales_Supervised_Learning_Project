# Liquor Sales Supervised Learning Project

Identify trends in Luxico Inc's liquor sales for Iowa. 

How well a liquor distributor prevents stockouts, optimizes distribution, and effectively advertizes can make or break thier success. The purpose of this project is to identify trends for Luxico Inc's liquor sales in Iowa that are critical to operating optimally. 

# DATA:

There are two sources of data in my project
1) Iowa Liqour Sales
2) Iowa Population Demographics

# DATA ANALYSIS:

# 1 : Exploratory Analysis:
This includes using the liquor sales dataset to visualze the relationships between sales (in dollars) and other features.

# 2 : Modeling Sales:
This includes using both datasets to predict yearly sales per county in Iowa using data from the previous year.

# Analysis 1 - Exploratory Analysis
- I divide the analysis into the following parts:
**A) Yearly Analysis**: sales per category, sales per county, sales per bottle volume
**B) Monthly Analysis**: total sales, sales per category
**C) Identifying Customer Base**: Analyzing relationship between population demographics and sales per county. 
**D) Predicting Sales**: Using demographic and sales data from 2017 to predict yearly sales per county for 2018.

# A) Yearly Analysis :
**Step 1 : Identifying the data**
In this step, I preformed the following using Google BigQuery
- Identify top distributers in Iowa Liquor Sales dataset, and audit the variety of alcohol each sells. 
- Filter dataset by a top distributer that selles a wide variety of alcohol -- Luxico Inc-- and year -- 2017-2018.

# Conclusion: Luxico Inc is the second largest distributer in Iowa, and sells 34 different categories of alcohol. 

# A) Yearly Analysis :
**Step 2 : Exploring the data**
In this step, I have preformed the following steps to get the result
- Used pandas functionalities to group by year, and preform various analysis
